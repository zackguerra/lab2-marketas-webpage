LAB 2 - WEB DEVELOPMENT - HTML AND CSS

1. Create an introductory page (Home) for a bed and breakfast website
The logo, the subtitle, and menu will appear using animation
First: logo will slide down, bounce a bit, and will be positioned properly.
Second: subtitle will change the letter-spacing and opacity
Third: menu will change its the width and opacity

*use the image files included for background and logo

2. When you hover a photo, description of each photo shows
using overflow and transition.

3. Complete the link (For Marketa’s Art, use Slide show) using the skill you’ve learned.

4. Leave the “Rooms and Rate” as a void link.

*Make the whole pages responsive. You are doing this lab to practice for the
middle term project next week. Use the GitHub and invite me as a
collaborator as well. Your group will do the presentation this Friday. Use
GitHub projects to keep logs of all the process.
